# Create Connection with MONGO

To use mongodb you must install mongodb on your windows.
In order to do this, you have to follow this link: 
https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community

After installing do this:
If you have installed mongodb in c: drive then run the following command in cmd
```
cd C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin
Create a folder  ‘data ‘ in your node js project folder and after that run the following command:
mongod.exe --dbpath F:\Project Path\data
```

# For Materialize CSS

## This is the Crud Mean project with Api's Authentication.

=>sCLI projects in angular 6 onwards uses angular.json instead of .angular-cli.json for build and project configuration. That implies you are using Angular 6. 
As of v6, the location of the file has changed to angular.json. Since there is no longer a leading dot, the file is no longer hidden by default and is on the same level. which also means that file paths in angular.json should not contain leading dots and slash i.e you should provide an absolute path 

# Install MaterializeCSS and angular2-materialize from npm

 npm install materialize-css --save 
 npm install angular2-materialize --save 
 npm install jquery@^2.2.4 --save
 npm install hammerjs --save

      "node_modules/materialize-css/dist/css/materialize.css"
],
"scripts": [
      "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js",
       "node_modules/hammerjs/hammer.js",
       "node_modules/materialize-css/dist/js/materialize.js"
 ]
 
 ```
